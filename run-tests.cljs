;; Measured 2026-08-20: of 22 kotoba-lang stdlib libraries, 12 had tests and
;; no way to run them on a second runtime. That is how kotoba-lang/bytes
;; shipped a SHA-1 that returned the wrong digest on ClojureScript, and how
;; kotoba-lang/lint shipped an error path that threw there instead of
;; reporting. Neither was visible to a JVM run, and a JVM run was all
;; either had.
;;
;;
;; nbb prints its own summary; this only supplies the exit code, because a
;; suite that fails while exiting 0 is worse than one that does not run.
